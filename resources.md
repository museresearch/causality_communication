### Potential Future Initiatives

* **Literature on competing approaches to and about causality:** A suggestion to broaden the website to include diverse philosophical and methodological perspectives on causality beyond specific statistical techniques.
* **Practical, user-friendly guide for translating causal research into social impact initiatives:** This idea suggests creating resources that bridge the gap between causal findings and actionable strategies, possibly through partnerships with organizations or nonprofits.
* **"R&R stage" papers:** Several contributors mentioned papers currently in "revise and resubmit" stage; these could be added once accepted and published.
